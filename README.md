> ‚ö†Ô∏è *As of September 2025, the official bot is not maintained. The reason is that I have lost access to my discord account, which owns the bot. If you want to use the bot, you need to set it up yourself, following the instructions provided at the bottom of this README. This repository will still be maintained though.*

## How to setup yourself

- `git clone https://github.com/alteregodev/OsintCord.git` - Clones the repository with the bot
